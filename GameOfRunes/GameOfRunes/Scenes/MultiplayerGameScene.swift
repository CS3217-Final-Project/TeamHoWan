/**
 `SKScene` for the multiplayer game. This game has 2 main games
 running at the same time (the local (main) game, and the remote (mini-map)
 game). Each game is updated by their own respective game engines, which
 in turn will update according to the normal game engine logic and periodically
 sync the game state with the game state obtained via the network (in order
 for multiplayer to function properly).
 - The local (main) game is rooted at `rootRenderNode` and is associated
 with the `MultiplayerLocalGameEngine`
 - The remote (mini-map) game is rooted at `remoteRootRenderNode` and
 is associated with the `MultiplayerRemoteGameEngine`
