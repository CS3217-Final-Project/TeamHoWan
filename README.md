## Game Concept

Game Of Runes is a gesture-based iPad game where the player attempts to destroy incoming enemies through swiping gestures.
The game itself takes on a medieval theme, and the player will have to defend his/her castle from invading enemies. At the start of each stage, the player can select an avatar. Each avatar has a set of power ups associated with it - these power ups can then be activated in the stage to aid the player in clearing the stage.
