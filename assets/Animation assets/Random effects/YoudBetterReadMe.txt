These are completely free to use in whatevere project you desire, be it a game, a hi-end visualisation of a camel poo, or.. well.. you‘re probably smarter than me, so I‘ll leave it up to you.

That being said, I‘d definitely love to see whatever you manage to do with them, so please please please, let me know if that happens!

Cheers :) Martin
